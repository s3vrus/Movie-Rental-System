For this project I created a Movie Rental System that connected to an Oracle database. It had admin and member options. Admin could log in and add, update, or delete any movies and members including member payment info. Members could log in and search, rent, or return movies. When the member would rent or return a movie the inventory would automatically update. Also attached the SQL to create the database.

Admin Username and Password: admin/ root
